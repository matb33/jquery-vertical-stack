## Vertical Stacking plugin for jQuery

Allows certain elements to stack against each other when scrolling by leveraging position:fixed. Useful for complex scenarios involving sticky elements (such as stick navs). You can have elements stack against each other, while others continue to flow normally.

See the example [https://raw.github.com/matb33/jquery-vertical-stack/master/index.html](index.html) for an example of usage. At this point, you'll need to peruse the source for instructions.

Let me know if you use this plug-in! That would help me get motivated to write documentation.
